### dijkstra 
- works with cycle 
- works with negative values 

- but the problem accures when both of them arrives 

### belman ford 
- dijksta have nodes but bellam ford uses edge relaxation
- bellman relaxes n-1 times 
    - n-1 because in each relaxation it is guranted there will be at least one node 
    - there are n nodes but shortes dis of starting node is already known that is zero 
    - so there are n-1 noods that need tobe known

### inf 
- there is no predefined funtionality for infinity
- we usually uses INT_MAX as infinity. but the problem is 
- int_max is specific value (2147483647). so where should be (inf-3 == inf) now 21...47-3< 21..47
