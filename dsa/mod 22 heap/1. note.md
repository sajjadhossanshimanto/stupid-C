### Perfect binary tree
- totally filled
               1
             /    \
            /      \
           /        \
          2          3
         / \        / \

       / \ / \    / \  / \
      8  9 1  2   3  4 5  6
### complete binary tree
- totally fill until the parent of leaf node
               1
             /    \
            /      \
           /        \

### array representation
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
               1
             /   \
            /     \
           /       \
          2         3
         / \       / \
        4   5     6   7

parent of any node -> (child_idx - 1) /2

left child  -> parent_idx*2 + 1
right child -> parent_idx*2 + 2

### BST
- left child is alwas smaller than root
- right child is always bigger than root

- for dublicate value we do not insert them to eighter left or right. 
    we way have a counter variable 

### heap
heap follows one single rule
- for max heap -> root is the largest value. all child of root is less than that no matter left or right
