### queue implimentation
queue is also a abstract or higher level data structure. stack can be implimented both with `array` and `linked list`
- use of `array` gives us O(N) popint from font
- `link list` is better suitable. both singly and doubly link list has O(1) pop push in font and back

### queue operations
there are only 5 valid operations in stack
- push
- pop
- front
- back -> we maintain 2 pointers for queue as we need to push at the back and pop from the font
- size
- empty
