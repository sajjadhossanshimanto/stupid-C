### stack implimentation
stack is a abstract or higher level data structure. stack can be implimented both with `array` and `linked list`
- but use `vector` in case of `array`
    - as we may need frequent increase and decrease of array size
- and use `doubly linklist` in case of `link list`
    - as we need to constantly remove from the tail
    - in `singly linklist` removal from tail cost O(N)

### stack operations
there are only 5 valid operations in stack
- push 
- pop
- top -> the only away to access a elemnet in stack. other than that we can't access any other element.
- size 
- empty
