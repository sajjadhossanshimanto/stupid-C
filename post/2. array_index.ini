Arrays in C are 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗯𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻! Unlike in higher-level languages, there's no boundary checking when indexing arrays, which can easily lead to buffer overflows or accessing memory from other variables.

No compiler warnings, no runtime errors — just potentially dangerous behavior 😓
How do you handle this in your code? Do you prefer manual boundary checks? Let’s discuss! 🛠️
